Notes on choosing driver circuit:
- Good writeup of linear current source vs switched mode current source here: https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/55823/how-can-i-efficiently-drive-an-led
-Efficiency of linear source:
https://www.instructables.com/id/Circuits-for-using-High-Power-LED-s/

(assuming maximum forward voltage)
red: 52%
green and blue: 72%
total average: 65%

- Looking at AL8860 switching LED driver, efficiency is 89% for this case
- For chosen driver, PAM2804, efficiency is ~86%


Thermal management notes (for LED):

Takeaway: connect LED thermal pad to ground plane with masked vias outside of the pad.

TI recommends putting thermal vias directly in the pad:
http://www.ti.com/lit/an/sloa120/sloa120.pdf

"If thin PCB boards or vias larger than 0,3 mm are used, designers may use only external vias to prevent
solder loss and protrusions (see Figure 6). Designers should note that this might reduce thermal
performance significantly and should be evaluated on their PCBs"

Possible option for thermal vias:

"IPC-70932 Section 6.1.5.3 gives the following guidance for voiding within thermal pads: “The presence of small voids in the thermal pad region is not likely to result in degradation of thermal and electrical performance, nor impact the reliability of perimeter I/O solder joints.”'
