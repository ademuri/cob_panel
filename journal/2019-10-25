Notes on choosing driver circuit:
- Good writeup of linear current source vs switched mode current source here: https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/55823/how-can-i-efficiently-drive-an-led
-Efficiency of linear source:

(assuming maximum forward voltage)
red: 83%
green and blue: 87%
total average: 86%

- Looking at AL8860 switching LED driver, efficiency is 89% for this case

- Going to modify LED driver design for higher efficiency by halving the sense voltage from .5v to .25v. Found a .36 Ohm, 1/2W resistor, for ~695mA.
