Notes on choosing driver circuit:
- Good writeup of linear current source vs switched mode current source here: https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/55823/how-can-i-efficiently-drive-an-led
-Efficiency of linear source:
https://www.instructables.com/id/Circuits-for-using-High-Power-LED-s/

(assuming maximum forward voltage)
red: 52%
green and blue: 72%
total average: 65%

- Looking at AL8860 switching LED driver, efficiency is 89% for this case
- For chosen driver, PAM2804, efficiency is ~86%


Thermal management notes (for LED):
Good description of how to thermal relief: https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/22853/can-i-include-heatsink-copper-in-a-kicad-footprint

Takeaway: connect LED thermal pad to ground plane with masked vias outside of the pad.
